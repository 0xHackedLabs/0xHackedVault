# 0xHacked Vault

## Design

When the white hat uploads proof of the exploit on 0xHacked.com, we will new a case in the 0xHacked Vault. The case contains the white hat's receiver address. After negotiating, the project and the white hat will reach an agreement. The project deposits the bounty to the 0xHacked Vault. Suppose the white hat doesn't provide the PoC. The project can choose to do nothing. The white hat won't benefit. Instead, if the white hat provides the PoC and assists in fixing the exploit. The project's willing to finish the bounty payment since they won't get the deposit back. The project and white hat incentives from both sides.

We will take a 5% commission when the white hat receives the bounty.
